	<p>
		This is a burger. I guess you've already seen this. It has a bun, a patty and a few vegetables here and there. Generally found in McDonalds and other fast food places. Not that healthy tho. Enjoy!

	<h2 class="hr b">Pizza</h2>
	<p>
		This is a pizza. A circular food that comes in a square box and cut into triangles. Weird right! Didn't know pizza would teach me Geometry haha. Now I'm thinking of what to write about Pizza as I'm busy eating it.

	<h2 class="hr s">Pasta</h2>
	<p>
		Pasta is an Italian Cuisine. Whenever I travel to Italy I always try the pasta. I visit a plumber over there whenever I visit Italy. You must've heard of Mario right? Yeah, he is my close friend and a very good chef.
