							Cue Apple music... Over the past few years Apple has been
							developing something amazing under the hood. We call it the
							Samsung Galaxy , OH SHOOT, sorry sorry, TAKE 2: We call it the
							iPhone(Ooooooooooo). To make it look amazing we have created
							something New Some thing BOLD. It's a revolutionary design. It
							looks just the same as the Pixel or the Samsung. BUT...... It has
							one feature which no other phone has or will have in the history
							of mankind.A BIG NOTCH.(Crowd Cheers) Audience goes mad,
							Undertaker from the back and boom he can't show his face for the
							next 6 months would you look at that. (Undertaker Music) We have
							one more thing...

							Epic Rap Battles of History: Bill Gates Varsus Let me just step
							right in I got things to invent I'm an innovator baby Change the
							world Fortune 500 before you kissed a girl I'm a pimp you're a
							nerd I'm slick you're cheesey Beating you is Apple II easy I make
							the product that the artist chooses And the GUI that Melinda uses
							I need ta bring up some basic shit Why'd you name your company
							after your dick? You blow, Jobs You arrogant prick With your
							second hand jeans and your turtleneck I'll drill a hole in the
							middle of your bony head With your own little spinning beach ball
							of death Hippie, you got given up at birth I give away your net
							worth to AIDS research Combine all your little toys and I still
							crush that IPhone, iPad, iPwn, iSmack A man uses the machines you
							built to sit down and pay his taxes A man uses the machines I
							built to Listen to the Beatles while he relaxes Well Steve, you
							steal all the credit for work that other people do Did your fat
							beard Wozniak write these raps for you too? Ooh, everybody knows
							Windows bit off apple I tripled the profits on a PC All the people
							with the power to create use an apple! And people with jobs use a
							PC You know I bet they made this beat on an apple Nope, Fruity
							Loops, PC You will never, ever catch a virus on an apple Well you
							could still afford a doctor if you bought a PC Let's talk about
							doctors, I've seen a few Cause I got a PC but it wasn't from you I
							built a legacy son, you could never stop it Now excuse me while I
							turn Heaven a profit Fine, you wanna be like that? Die Then! The
							whole world loved you but you were my friend I'm alone now with
							nothing but power and time And no one on earth who can challenge
							my mind! I'm a boss! I own dos! Your future is MY design! I'm a
							god! Own Xbox! Now there's no-one to stop me, the world is mine!
							I'm sorry Bill, I'm afraid I can't let you do that Take a look at
							your history, everything you built leads up to me I got the power
							of a mind you could never be I'll beat your ass in chess and
							Jeopardy I'm running C++ saying "hello world" I'll beat you 'til
							you're singing about a daisy girl I'm coming out the socket
							Nothing you can do can stop it I'm on your lap and in your pocket
							How you gonna shoot me down when I guide the rocket? Your cortex
							just doesn't impress me So go ahead try to Turing test me I stomp
							on a Mac and a PC too I'm on Linux bh, I thought you GNU My CPU's
							hot but my core runs cold Beat you in seventeen lines of code I
							think different from the engine of the days of old Hasta la vista,
							like the Terminator told ya
